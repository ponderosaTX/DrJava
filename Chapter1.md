Chapter�1.�Introduction
-----------------------

DrJava is a programming environment for Java, primarily intended to help students focus more on program design than on the features of a complicated development environment. DrJava also provides many advanced features for experienced developers. These features center around DrJava's Interactions Pane, which is a "read-eval-print loop" that allows users to easily develop, test, and debug Java programs in an interactive, incremental manner.
